  abstract	= {One major concern for operators of Long Term Evolution
		  (LTE) networks is mitigating inter-cell interference
		  problems. Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (ICIC)
		  techniques are proposed to reduce performance degradation
		  and to maximize system capacity. It is a joint resource
		  allocation and power allocation problem that aims at
		  controlling the trade-off between resource efficiency and
		  user fairness. Traditional interference mitigation
		  techniques are Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR) and Soft
		  Frequency Reuse (SFR). FFR statically divides the available
		  spectrum into reuse-1 and reuse-3 portions in order to
		  protect cell-edge users, while SFR reduces downlink
		  transmission power allocated for cell-center resources to
		  protect vulnerable users in the neighboring cells. However,
		  these static techniques are not adapted to non-uniform user
		  distribution scenarios, and they do not provide guarantees
		  on throughput fairness between user equipments. In this
		  paper, we introduce a non-cooperative dynamic ICIC
		  technique that dynamically adjusts resource block
		  allocation according to user demands in each zone. We
		  investigate the impact of this technique on throughput
		  distribution and user fairness under non-uniform user
		  distributions, using an LTE downlink system level
		  simulator. Simulation results show that the proposed
		  technique improves system capacity, and increases
		  throughput fairness in comparison with reuse-1 model, FFR
		  and SFR. It does not require any cooperation between base
		  stations of the LTE network.},

  abstract	= {Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (ICIC) is commonly
		  identified as a key radio resource management mechanism to
		  enhance system performance of 4G networks. This paper
		  addresses the problem of ICIC in the downlink of cellular
		  OFDMA systems where the power level selection process of
		  resource blocks (RBs) is apprehended as a sub-modular game.
		  The existence of Nash equilibriums (NE) for that type of
		  games shows that stable power allocations can be reached by
		  selfish Base Stations (BS). We put forward a semi
		  distributed algorithm based on best response dynamics to
		  attain the NEs of the modeled game. Based on local
		  knowledge conveyed by the X2 interface in LTE (Long Term
		  Evolution) networks, each BS will first select a pool of
		  favorable RBs with low interference. Second, each BS will
		  strive to fix the power level adequately on those selected
		  RBs realizing performances comparable with the Max Power
		  policy that uses full power on selected RBs while achieving
		  substantial power economy. Finally, we compare the obtained
		  results to an optimal global solution to quantify the
		  efficiency loss of the distributed game approach. It turns
		  out that even though the distributed game results are
		  sub-optimal, the low degree of system complexity and the
		  inherent adaptability make the decentralized approach

		  operators have to face a continuing growth of new types of
		  Internet traffic (video, games, telepresence, etc.)
		  imposing not only a more efficient utilization of their
		  network infrastructure resources, but also the generation
		  of new revenues to pursue investments and sustain the
		  increasing demand. Such services generally cross multiple
		  domains, but inter-domain routing protocols still have some
		  limitations in terms of service assurance. For example,
		  BGP's single route announce for a destination limits
		  potential traffic engineering features (e.g. no quality of
		  service price/efficiency optimisation, inter-domain shared
		  route protection, inter-domain load balancing, etc.). In
		  order to provision end-to-end inter-domain connections that
		  obey to constraints such as bandwidth, delay, jitter, and
		  packet loss for these services, an interesting approach is
		  to compute e2e paths over multiple inter-domain routes.
		  This will allow establishing more efficiently the
		  inter-domain connections with respect to requested QoS
		  constraints and sharing these constraints (and associated

		  However, extending the QoS routing to the inter-domain

  abstract	= {Frequency reuse-1 model is required to satisfy the
		  exponential increase of data demands in mobile networks,
		  such as the Long Term Evolution (LTE) of Universal Mobile
		  Terrestrial radio access System (UMTS). However, the
		  simultaneous usage of the same frequency resources in
		  adjacent LTE cells creates inter-cell interference
		  problems, that mainly affect cell-edge users. Inter-Cell
		  Interference Coordination (ICIC) techniques are proposed to
		  avoid the negative impact of interference on system
		  performance. They establish restrictions on resource usage,
		  such as Fractional Frequency Reuse (FFR), and on power
		  allocation such as Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR). In this
		  paper, we classify the existing ICIC techniques, and
		  investigate the performance of reuse-1, reuse-3, FFR, and
		  SFR schemes under various user distributions, and for
		  various network loads. Performance of cell-center and
		  cell-edge users are inspected, as well as the overall
		  spectral efficiency. System level simulations show the
		  advantages and limitations of each of the examined
		  techniques compared to frequency reuse-1 model Under

  abstract	= {Inter-cell interference problems arise in dense frequency
		  reuse networks such as Long Term Evolution (LTE). They have
		  harmful impact on system performance, especially for
		  cell-edge users or users having bad radio conditions.
		  Inter-Cell Interference Coordination (ICIC) schemes aim at
		  mitigating the interference produced by nearby cells to
		  enhance the performance of cell-edge users. ICIC techniques
		  include static frequency reuse schemes and cell-coordinated
		  schemes. In this paper, we propose a semi-static frequency
		  allocation algorithm that exploits evolved-NodeBs
		  communications via X2 interface to mitigate inter-cell
		  interference. Each cell is divided into two zones:
		  cell-center and cell-edge. Cell zone satisfaction is
		  tracked, and the unsatisfied zone gets more frequency
		  resource blocks in a distributed manner. The scope of this
		  work is on the downlink of LTE networks using frequency
		  division duplex transmission mode. An LTE downlink system
		  level simulator is chosen to compare the performance of the
		  proposed technique with the frequency reuse-1 model and the
		  fractional frequency reuse technique. Simulation results
		  show that our technique improves throughput cumulative
		  distribution function, achieves a better throughput
		  fairness, and reduces the percentage of unsatisfied users.
		  It is a dynamic technique able to adapt with non-uniform
		  user distributions and traffic demands.},

  abstract	= {Abstract In wireless access networks, one of the most
		  recent challenges is reducing the power consumption of the
		  network, while preserving the quality of service perceived
		  by users. Hence, mobile operators are rethinking their
		  network design by considering two objectives, namely,
		  saving power and guaranteeing a satisfactory quality of
		  service. Since these objectives are conflicting, a tradeoff
		  becomes inevitable. We formulate a multi-objective
		  optimization with aims of minimizing the network power
		  consumption and transmission delay. Power saving is
		  achieved by adjusting the operation mode of the network
		  base stations from high transmit power levels to low
		  transmit levels or even sleep mode. Minimizing the
		  transmission delay is achieved by selecting the best user
		  association with the network base stations. In this
		  article, we cover two different technologies: \{IEEE\}
		  802.11 and LTE. Our formulation captures the specificity of
		  each technology in terms of the power model and radio
		  resource allocation. After exploring typical
		  multi-objective approaches, we resort to a weighted sum
		  mixed integer linear program. This enables us to
		  efficiently tune the impact of the power and delay
		  objectives. We provide extensive simulations for various
		  preference settings that enable to assess the tradeoff
		  between power and delay in \{IEEE\} 802.11 \{WLANs\} and
		  \{LTE\} networks. We show that for a power minimization
		  setting, a \{WLAN\} consumes up to 16% less power than
		  legacy solutions. A thorough analysis of the optimization
		  results reveals the impact of the network topology,
		  particularly the inter-cell distance, on both objectives.
		  For an \{LTE\} network, we assess the impact of urban,
		  rural and realistic deployments on the achievable
		  tradeoffs. The power savings mainly depend on user
		  distribution and the power consumption of the sleep mode.
		  Compared with legacy solutions, we obtained power savings
		  of up to 22.3% in a realistic \{LTE\} networks. When
		  adequately tuned, our optimization approach reduces the
		  transmission delay by up to 6% in a \{WLAN\} and 8% in an \{LTE\} network. },
