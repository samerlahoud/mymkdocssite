In this paper, we consider possible power saving through reducing the number of active BSs and adjusting the transmit power of those that remain active while maintaining a satisfying service for all users in the network. Thus, we introduce an optimization problem that jointly minimizes the power consumption of the network and the sum of the transmission delays of the users in the network. Our formulation allows investigating the tradeoff between power and delay by tuning the weighting factors associated to each one. Moreover, to reduce the computational complexity of the optimal solution of our non-linear optimization problem, we convert it into a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). We provide extensive simulations for various decision preferences such as power minimization, delay minimization and joint minimization of power and delay.

  abstract	= {The growing energy demands, the increasing depletion of
		  traditional energy resources, together coupled with the
		  recent explosion of mobile internet traffic call for green
		  solutions to address the challenges in energy efficient
		  wireless access networks. In this paper, we consider
		  possible power saving through reducing the number of active
		  BSs and adjusting the transmit power of those that remain
		  active while maintaining a satisfying service for all users
		  in the network. Thus, we introduce an optimization problem
		  that jointly minimizes the power consumption of the network
		  and the sum of the transmission delays of the users in the
		  network. Our formulation allows investigating the tradeoff
		  between power and delay by tuning the weighting factors
		  associated to each one. Moreover, to reduce the

Most of the existing research in QoS routing has been done considering a single domain. However, extending the QoS routing to the inter-domain level faces two major challenges: the scalability and the domain autonomy. In this paper, we propose a novel inter-domain QoS routing algorithm based on a hybrid computation scheme, named HID-MCP. The hybrid computation scheme combines the on-demand computation scheme and the pre-computation schemes taking benefits from these two computation schemes. Particularly, the hybrid computation allows speeding up the response time while providing a high success rate. Moreover, our algorithm reinforces the domain autonomy and solves the scaling problem by distributing the computations between domains.

  abstract	= {{Enabling the inter-domain routing with end-to-end Quality
		  of Service (QoS) guarantees, remains a challenge for the
		  next generation Internet. Most of the existing research in
		  QoS routing has been done considering a single domain.
		  However, extending the QoS routing to the inter-domain
		  level faces two major challenges: the scalability and the
		  domain autonomy. In this paper, we propose a novel
		  inter-domain QoS routing algorithm based on a hybrid
		  computation scheme, named HID-MCP. The hybrid computation
		  scheme combines the on-demand computation scheme and the
		  pre-computation schemes taking benefits from these two
		  computation schemes. Particularly, the hybrid computation
		  allows speeding up the response time while providing a high

		  This paper studies how many nodes in optical networks must
		  be equipped with light splitters to assure good performance
		  of multicast algorithms in sparse splitting networks. This
		  depends basically on the topology in terms of number of
		  nodes, the average node degree and the variation of the
		  node degree distribution over the network nodes. The more
		  the variation of the node degree is, the more splitters are
		  required.},

When their radio resources are jointly managed, heterogeneous networks inevitably enhance resource utilization and user experience. In this context, we tackle the Radio Access Technology (RAT) selection and propose a hybrid decision framework that integrates operator objectives and user preferences. Mobile users are assisted in their decisions by the network that broadcasts cost and QoS parameters. By signaling appropriate decisional information, the network tries to globally control users decision in a way to meet operator objectives. Besides, mobiles combine their needs and preferences with the signaled network information, and select their access technology so as to maximize their own utility. Deriving network information is formulated as a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP).
